## Basic concepts

### Computer:

A computer is like a super-smart tool that helps you solve problems, make calculations, and manage information. Think
of it as a machine that takes your instructions and does what you ask it to do, whether that’s typing a document, 
playing a game, or browsing the web. It’s a combination of hardware (the physical parts) and software (the programs 
that make it work).

### Data In, Data Out Process:

- This is how a computer interacts with the world. It’s like when you ask a question and get an answer:

- Input (Data In): The information you give the computer, like typing on a keyboard or clicking with a mouse. It's 
similar to telling the computer what you want it to do.

- Processing: The computer takes that input and works with it (using its brain, called a processor). It figures out 
what to do, like solving a puzzle or following steps.

Output (Data Out): The result or response from the computer. This could be showing something on the screen, playing a 
sound, or printing a document. It’s like getting the answer after the computer finishes its work.

### Hardware:

Hardware is all the physical stuff you can touch in a computer—like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and processor inside
the computer box. It’s the body of the computer. Just like a car needs an engine and wheels to work, a computer needs 
its hardware to function.

### Software:

Software is the set of instructions or programs that tell the computer what to do. It’s like the brain or mind of the 
computer. While hardware is the body, the software is the ideas and knowledge that make it work. Examples include your 
web browser, games, and operating systems like Windows or macOS.

### Computing:

Computing is basically problem-solving using a computer. It’s the process of inputting data, processing it, and then
outputting results. When you use a computer for anything—like sending an email, solving math problems, or making 
music—you’re doing computing.

In simple terms, computing is making the computer do work for you based on the instructions or programs (software) 
it’s given, using its hardware to handle information and get results.
