# Coding environment

## Basic concepts

### Computer:

A computer is like a super-smart tool that helps you solve problems, make calculations, and manage information. Think
of it as a machine that takes your instructions and does what you ask it to do, whether that’s typing a document, 
playing a game, or browsing the web. It’s a combination of hardware (the physical parts) and software (the programs 
that make it work).

### Data In, Data Out Process:

- This is how a computer interacts with the world. It’s like when you ask a question and get an answer:

- Input (Data In): The information you give the computer, like typing on a keyboard or clicking with a mouse. It's 
similar to telling the computer what you want it to do.

- Processing: The computer takes that input and works with it (using its brain, called a processor). It figures out 
what to do, like solving a puzzle or following steps.

Output (Data Out): The result or response from the computer. This could be showing something on the screen, playing a 
sound, or printing a document. It’s like getting the answer after the computer finishes its work.

### Hardware:

Hardware is all the physical stuff you can touch in a computer—like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and processor inside
the computer box. It’s the body of the computer. Just like a car needs an engine and wheels to work, a computer needs 
its hardware to function.

### Software:

Software is the set of instructions or programs that tell the computer what to do. It’s like the brain or mind of the 
computer. While hardware is the body, the software is the ideas and knowledge that make it work. Examples include your 
web browser, games, and operating systems like Windows or macOS.

### Computing:

Computing is basically problem-solving using a computer. It’s the process of inputting data, processing it, and then
outputting results. When you use a computer for anything—like sending an email, solving math problems, or making 
music—you’re doing computing.

In simple terms, computing is making the computer do work for you based on the instructions or programs (software) 
it’s given, using its hardware to handle information and get results.

## Python coding style

Python is a simple, easy-to-read programming language. It uses plain English-like syntax, making it a great choice for 
beginners. Python emphasizes writing code in a clear and organized way, using indentation and following specific rules.

**Reserved Words in Python:**

Reserved words (or keywords) are special words that Python uses for specific purposes. You cannot use these as variable
names because they have predefined meanings in the language.

Here’s a list of Python's reserved words:

```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

**Indentation:**

Indentation in Python refers to adding spaces or tabs at the beginning of lines to define blocks of code. Unlike many
other languages, Python uses indentation to organize code and show the structure (e.g., for loops or conditionals).

*Incorrect Example (without indentation):*

```python
if True:
print("This will cause an error")
```

*Correct Example:*

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
```

Python requires indentation, so make sure you indent consistently, usually by 4 spaces, to keep your code readable and
error-free.
